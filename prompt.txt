I'm working on a Figma-to-Angular integration app called DesignPrototype. Please read the README2.md file first to understand the complete project context, then help me continue development.

Current Status:
- Backend: Node.js server (port 3200) with enhanced multi-file sync and rate limiting
- Frontend: Angular 17+ with enhanced design system and modern UI
- Current state: COMPLETE enhanced implementation with 13,047 tokens and 1,481 components
- Goal: Continue development and add new features to the enhanced design system

Key Information:
- Enhanced token extraction: 13,047 tokens with categorization and usage tracking
- Enhanced component extraction: 1,481 components with token relationships
- Multi-file support: Priority-based syncing across multiple Figma files
- Modern UI: Beautiful, responsive design system interface
- HTML preview system: Component-specific HTML generation with caching

Architecture:
- Backend: server/mcp-figma-server.js (enhanced with multi-file support)
- Enhanced Services: server/services/enhanced-token-extractor.js, enhanced-component-extractor.js
- Frontend: src/app/components/enhanced-design-system/ (modern design system UI)
- Service: src/app/services/figma-server.service.ts (enhanced backend communication)
- Storage: server/storage/ (enhanced-figma-cache.json with 23MB+ data)

Enhanced API Endpoints:
- GET /api/mcp/figma/enhanced/tokens → Returns enhanced tokens with categorization
- GET /api/mcp/figma/enhanced/components → Returns enhanced components with token usage
- GET /api/mcp/figma/enhanced/sync → Enhanced sync with token-component linking
- GET /api/mcp/figma/page-flows → Returns containers (legacy)
- GET /api/mcp/figma/container/:id/pages → Returns individual pages (legacy)

Current Data:
- Enhanced Tokens: 13,047 (with categorization and usage tracking)
- Enhanced Components: 1,481 (with token relationships)
- Legacy Tokens: 11,572 (backward compatibility)
- Legacy Components: 736 (backward compatibility)
- Pages: 3 (Symbols, Sitemap, Test)

Please read README2.md for complete technical details, then help me continue development of the enhanced design system platform.
